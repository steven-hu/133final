<title> The {do.call} function</title>
 
<h1 align="center">The <tt>do.call</tt> function </h1>



R has an interesting function called <tt>do.call</tt>.  This
function allows you to call any R function, but instead of writing
out the arguments one by one, you can use a list to hold the 
arguments of the function.  While it may not seem useful on the 
surface, a simple example will help to show how powerful <tt>do.call</tt>
is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Suppose we have three comma-separated text files that have information
on the same three variables.  
Here's a look at the first few lines in one of the files:

<pre>
a,b,x,y
b,B,2.49778634403711,-0.351307445767206
b,A,-0.594683138631719,1.19629936975021
b,D,1.14857619580259,0.653315728121014
c,A,0.957476532595248,0.935608419299617

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's easy to read each one in with 
<tt>read.csv</tt>, and then to call the <tt>rbind</tt> (combine by 
rows) function to make one big data frame.  (Remember that <tt>rbind</tt>
will only work if all the data frames being combined have the same variable
names.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;one&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.csv('1.csv')
&#62;&nbsp;nrow(one)
[1]&nbsp;21
&#62;&nbsp;two&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.csv('2.csv')
&#62;&nbsp;nrow(two)
[1]&nbsp;25
&#62;&nbsp;three&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.csv('3.csv')
&#62;&nbsp;nrow(three)
[1]&nbsp;27
&#62;&nbsp;big&nbsp;=&nbsp;rbind(one,two,three)
&#62;&nbsp;nrow(big)
[1]&nbsp;73

</pre>
 As I said, that was pretty easy.  But now suppose we have 
20 csv files that we want to read and combine.  We could do what we 
did with the three files, but, not only would it get tiring, there's
a chance of making an error when we have to type so many commands.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the past, when we've had problems like this, <tt>sapply</tt> was able
to help.  Let's try it here, by writing a function that will take a 
number, create a filename by pasting <tt>.csv</tt> at the end, and reading
in the data:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;allframes&nbsp;=&nbsp;sapply(1:20,function(x)read.csv(paste(x,'csv',sep='.')))
&#62;&nbsp;head(allframes)
&nbsp;&nbsp;[,1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,7]
a&nbsp;factor,21&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,25&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,27&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,25&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,27&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,21&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,24
b&nbsp;factor,21&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,25&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,27&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,25&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,27&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,21&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,24
x&nbsp;Numeric,21&nbsp;Numeric,25&nbsp;Numeric,27&nbsp;Numeric,25&nbsp;Numeric,27&nbsp;Numeric,21&nbsp;Numeric,24
y&nbsp;Numeric,21&nbsp;Numeric,25&nbsp;Numeric,27&nbsp;Numeric,25&nbsp;Numeric,27&nbsp;Numeric,21&nbsp;Numeric,24
&nbsp;&nbsp;[,8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,13]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[,14]
a&nbsp;factor,28&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,23&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,23&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,22&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,26&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,24&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,23
b&nbsp;factor,28&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,23&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,23&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,22&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,26&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,24&nbsp;&nbsp;factor,23
x&nbsp;Numeric,28&nbsp;Numeric,23&nbsp;Numeric,23&nbsp;Numeric,22&nbsp;Numeric,26&nbsp;Numeric,24&nbsp;Numeric,23

</pre>
 There were no errors, but the result certainly is strange 
looking!  While we haven't talked about it before, the "s" in <tt>sapply</tt>
stands for <em>simplify</em>, and the problem that we've just seen is that
<tt>sapply</tt> tried too hard to simplify our result.  It created an
odd matrix, where each element represents one of the columns of one of 
the files we read in.  Fortunately, there's a function that's closely related
to <tt>sapply</tt> called <tt>lapply</tt>.  The difference between <tt>sapply</tt> and 
<tt>lapply</tt> is that <tt>lapply</tt> will never try to simplify its 
results.  It will always return a list, the same length as its first 
argument, with each element of the list resulting in the function we 
passed to <tt>lapply</tt> operating on one element of the first argument.
In our case, calling <tt>lapply</tt> instead of <tt>sapply</tt> will give
us a list of length 20, where each element is the result of calling 
<tt>read.csv</tt> on one of the 20 files.  This is where <tt>do.call</tt>
comes in.  Instead of having to pass 20 data frames to <tt>rbind</tt>, we
can use <tt>do.call</tt> to pass all 20 of them to <tt>rbind</tt>, since they
are in a list, and that's exactly what <tt>do.call</tt> is looking for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;allframes&nbsp;=&nbsp;lapply(1:20,function(x)read.csv(paste(x,'csv',sep='.')))
&#62;&nbsp;sapply(allframes,nrow)
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;21&nbsp;25&nbsp;27&nbsp;25&nbsp;27&nbsp;21&nbsp;24&nbsp;28&nbsp;23&nbsp;23&nbsp;22&nbsp;26&nbsp;24&nbsp;23&nbsp;25&nbsp;29&nbsp;28&nbsp;30&nbsp;27&nbsp;29
&#62;&nbsp;answer&nbsp;=&nbsp;do.call(rbind,allframes)
&#62;&nbsp;nrow(answer)
[1]&nbsp;507

</pre>
 We can combine all the data frames without storing them 
separately or passing them individually to <tt>rbind</tt>.
