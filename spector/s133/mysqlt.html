<title> Setting up an SSH Tunnel to Access the MySQL server</title>
 
<h1 align="center">Setting up an SSH Tunnel to Access the MySQL server </h1>
In order to access the MySQL server from outside the SCF network under 
Windows, you'll
need to set up an SSH tunnel using <tt>putty</tt>.
It's a very simple procedure which you
only need to set up once.  (For Linux and Mac OSX, look at the last 
paragraph to see how to set up an SSH tunnel.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you don't already have <tt>putty</tt>, 
you can download it from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/&nbsp;sgtatham/putty/download.html</a>.  To set up a tunnel
using <tt>putty</tt>, first click the plus sign by the <tt>SSH</tt> menu choice in
the left pane of the main window, and then click on <tt>Tunnels</tt>.  Fill in the
information as shown in this screenshot:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="putty.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once the information is in place, click the <tt>Add</tt> button to create the 
tunnel.  Make sure that the string "<tt>L3306</tt>" appears in the box which
describes the forwarded ports.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, click on the <tt>Session</tt> menu choice at the top of the left-hand pane, and
enter any valid SCF host in the <tt>Host Name</tt> window.  Click on <tt>Open</tt>,
and log in with your SCF username and password.   Note that you
you must be logged in for the tunnel to be activated, even if you won't be typing
any commands into the shell.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once the tunnel is established, any MySQL client (like the graphical one you 
can find at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">mysql.com</a>
 or R) will be able to connect to the standard MySQL
port on your computer, using the id and password from class, and the tunnel will 
transfer the connection to the 
SCF machine on which the database is running.  If you need a hostname, use
"127.0.0.1".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you're using Mac OSX or Linux on your own computer, you can set up an SSH tunnel to 
the mysql server by typing the following command in a terminal window.  (On a Mac, you
can find the terminal application in <tt>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</tt>)

<pre>
ssh&nbsp;-N&nbsp;-L&nbsp;3306:springer.berkeley.edu:3306&nbsp;s133xx@any-scf-host

</pre>
 where <tt>any-scf-host</tt> is the name of any scf host (except gandalf), and
<tt>s133xx</tt> is your SCF login id.
You'll be prompted for your password; once you enter it, you can put the <tt>ssh</tt>
command in the background by typing Control-z, and then <tt>bg</tt>.
On a Mac, you'll need to include <tt>host="127.0.0.1"</tt> in your call to 
<tt>dbConnect</tt> when using an SSH tunnel to connect to the MySQL database.
