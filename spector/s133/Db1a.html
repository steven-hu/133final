 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lattice Graphics</h2>
The lattice library is actually flexible enough to produce separate plots 
for each state:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;xyplot(Diabetes~Prim_Care_Phys_Rate|CHSI_State_Name,data=risk,main='Diabetes&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;Physician&nbsp;Rate&nbsp;by&nbsp;Region')

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="diastate.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Looking at the plot, we should make some elements of the plot 
smaller, namely the titles on the strips and the points themselves:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;xyplot(Diabetes~Prim_Care_Phys_Rate|CHSI_State_Name,data=risk,main='Diabetes&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;Physician&nbsp;Rate&nbsp;by&nbsp;Region',cex=.5,par.strip.text=list(cex=.6))

</pre>
This results in the following plot:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="diastate1.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, let's suppose that we want to break up the plots into two pages, 
each with 25 plots in a 5x5 arrangement.  To get exactly 50 states, we'll
use the <tt>subset=</tt> argument of the lattice functions to remove Alaska
(for which there's no data), and the <tt>layout=</tt> argument to arrange
the plots the way we want, and the <tt>page=</tt> argument to call a function
at the end of each page:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;xyplot(Diabetes~Prim_Care_Phys_Rate|CHSI_State_Name,data=risk,main='Diabetes&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;Physician&nbsp;Rate&nbsp;by&nbsp;Region',subset=CHSI_State_Name&nbsp;!=&nbsp;'Alaska',layout=c(5,5,2),page=readline)

</pre>
 You can run this example to see the two pages.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now that we've seen some of the basics of how the lattice library routines
work, we'll take a look at some of the functions that are available.  Remember
that there are usually similar alternatives available among the traditional 
graphics functions, so you can think of these as additional choices that are 
available, and not necessarily the only possibility for producing a particular
type of plot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Univariate Displays</h2>
Univariate displays are plots that are concerned with the 
distribution of a single variable, 
possibly comparing the distribution among several subsamples of the 
data.  They are especially useful when you are first getting acquainted 
with a data set, since you may be able to identify outliers or other 
problems that could get masked by more complex displays or analyses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>dotplot</tt></h3>
A simple but surprisingly useful display for small to moderate amounts of 
univariate data is the  dotplot.  Each observation's value for a variable
is plotted as a dot along a line that spans the range of the variable's
value.  In the usual case, there will be several such lines, one for each
level of a grouping variable, making it very easy to spot differences 
in the variable's distribution for different groups.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To illustrate, we'll use a a data set from a wine recognition experiment where 
a number of chemical and other measurements were taken on wines from three 
cultivars.  
The data is available at <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wine.data">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wine.data</a>;  information about
the variables is at <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wine.names">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wine.names</a>
Suppose we are interested in comparing the alcohol 
level of wines from the three different cultivars:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;wine&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.csv('http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wine.data',header=FALSE)
&#62;&nbsp;names(wine)&nbsp;=&nbsp;c("Cultivar",&nbsp;"Alcohol",&nbsp;"Malic.acid",&nbsp;"Ash",&nbsp;"Alkalinity.ash",
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magnesium",&nbsp;"Phenols",&nbsp;"Flavanoids",&nbsp;"NF.phenols",&nbsp;"Proanthocyanins",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Color.intensity","Hue","OD.Ratio","Proline")
&#62;&nbsp;wine$Cultivar&nbsp;=&nbsp;factor(wine$Cultivar)
&#62;&nbsp;dotplot(Cultivar~Alcohol,data=wine,ylab='Cultivar')

</pre>
The plot is shown below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="dpalc.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>bwplot</tt></h3>
The <tt>bwplot</tt> produces box/whisker plots.  Unfortunately, notched
boxplots are not currently available using <tt>bwplot</tt>.  To create 
a box/whisker plot of Alcohol for the three cultivars, we can use
the same formula we passed to <tt>dotplot</tt>:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;bwplot(Alcohol~Cultivar,data=wine,xlab='Cultivar',ylab='Alcohol')

</pre>
The plot is shown below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="bwalc.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For both <tt>dotplot</tt> and <tt>bwplot</tt>, if you switch the roles of 
the variables in the formula, the orientation of the plot will change.  In
other words, the lines in the dotplot will be displayed vertically instead
of horizontally, and the boxplots will be displayed horizontally instead
of vertically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As a second example, consider the literacy rates for the different continents
in the world data set.  We can compare these rates using the following command:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;bwplot(literacy~cont,data=world,main='Literacy&nbsp;Rates&nbsp;by&nbsp;Continent')

</pre>
 The plot is shown below

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="bwlit.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>densityplot</tt></h3>
As its name implies, this function produces smoothed plots of densities,
similar to passing a call to the <tt>density</tt> function to the <tt>plot</tt>
function.  To compare multiple groups, it's best to create a conditioning
plot:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;densityplot(~Alcohol|Cultivar,data=wine)

</pre>
Notice that, for plots like this, the formula doesn't have a left hand 
side.  The plot is shown below:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="denalc.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As another example of a custom panel function, suppose we wanted to 
eliminate the points that are plotted near the x-axis and replace them 
with what is known as a rug - a set of tickmarks pointing up from the 
x-axis that show where the observations were.  In practice, many people
simply define panel functions like this on the fly.  After consulting 
the help pages for <tt>panel.densityplot</tt> and <tt>panel.rug</tt>, 
we could replace the points
with a rug as follows:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;densityplot(~Alcohol|Cultivar,data=wine,panel=function(x,...){
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel.densityplot(x,plot.points=FALSE)
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel.rug(x=x)
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})

</pre>
Of course, if you find it easier or more convenient to define a custom
panel function separate from the call to the plotting function, you can
use that method.  Here's the result:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="rdpalc.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>barchart</tt></h2>
A bar chart is like a histogram for categorical data.  The <tt>barchart</tt>
function expects its input data frame to already have the numbers of 
observations for each grouping tabulated.  For the simplest case of a single
variable with no conditioning variable, you can use a call to <tt>table</tt>
on the right hand side of the tilda to produce a vertical bar chart:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;barchart(~table(cont),data=world)

</pre>
The plot is shown below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="cbar.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For more complex barcharts, a data frame containing the counts to be plotted 
needs to be constructed.  This can be done easily using the <tt>table</tt>
in conjunction with <tt>as.data.frame</tt>.  To illustrate, we'll return to
the movies data set which has the release dates and box office receipts for
some of the all-time most popular movies.  Suppose we want to see if the 
distribution of the day of the week the movies opened on has changed over 
time.  First, we'll read the data and create a grouping variable for different
time periods:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;movies&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.delim('http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/movies.txt',as.is=TRUE,sep='|')
&#62;&nbsp;movies$box&nbsp;=&nbsp;as.numeric(sub('\\$','',movies$box))
&#62;&nbsp;movies$date&nbsp;=&nbsp;as.Date(movies$date,'%B&nbsp;%d,&nbsp;%Y')
&#62;&nbsp;movies$year&nbsp;=&nbsp;as.numeric(format(movies$date,'%Y'))
&#62;&nbsp;movies$weekday&nbsp;=&nbsp;factor(weekdays(movies$date),
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;levels=c('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'))
&#62;&nbsp;movies$yrgrp&nbsp;=&nbsp;cut(movies$year,c(1936,1980,1985,1990,1995,2000,2006,2011),
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labels=c('1937-1979','1980-1984','1985-1990','1991-1995','1996-2000','2001-2006','2007-2010'))&nbsp;
&#62;&nbsp;counts&nbsp;=&nbsp;as.data.frame(table(yrgrp=movies$yrgrp,weekday=movies$weekday))
&#62;&nbsp;barchart(Freq~weekday|yrgrp,data=counts,scales=list(x=list(rot=90)),as.table=TRUE)

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The plot is shown below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="mbar.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the roles of <tt>Freq</tt> and <tt>weekday</tt> were reversed in the 
previous call to <tt>barchart</tt>, the bars would be drawn horizontally
instead of vertically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;3-D Plots: <tt>cloud</tt></h2>
The three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional <tt>xyplot</tt> in the 
lattice library is <tt>cloud</tt>.  By using a conditioning variable, 
<tt>cloud</tt> can allow us to consider the relationship of four variables
at once.  To illustrate, here's conditioning plot showing the relationship
among four variables from the <tt>wine</tt> data frame:

<pre>
cloud(Alcohol&nbsp;~&nbsp;Color.intensity&nbsp;+&nbsp;Malic.acid|cut(Hue,4),data=wine)

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The plot is shown below:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="cloud.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One important point about lattice graphics is that they operate slightly
differently from R's traditional graphics.  When you type a lattice 
command at the top level R session, it's R's automatic printing that 
actually displays the plot.  So if you're calling a lattice function 
in a function or source file, you'll need to surround the call with a 
call to the <tt>print</tt> function, or store the result of the lattice
plot in a variable, and print that variable.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreadsheets</h2>
Spreadsheets, in particular the "xls" format used by Microsoft Excel, are 
one of the most common (if not the most common) methods for transfering 
data from one organization to another.  When you download or receive a 
spreadsheet, it's often a good idea to make sure that it really is a 
spreadsheet.  Comma-separated files, which are easily read into spreadsheet
programs, are often erroneously labeled "spreadsheets" or "Excel files",
and may even have an incorrect extension of <tt>".xls"</tt>.  
In addition, Excel spreadsheets are often used to hold largely textual 
information, so simply finding a spreadsheet that appears to contain data
can be misleading.
Furthermore, many 
systems are configured to use a spreadsheet program to automatically open
files with an extension of <tt>".csv"</tt>, further adding to the confusion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For many years, the only reliable way to read an Excel spreadsheet was with
Microsoft Excel, which is only available on Windows and Mac OS computers;
users on UNIX were left with no option other than finding a different computer.
In the last few years, a number of programs, notably <tt>gnumeric</tt> and 
OpenOffice.org (usually
available through the <tt>ooffice</tt> command)
have been developed through careful reverse engineering to allow Unix users
the ability to work with these files.  
To insure its advantage in the marketplace, Microsoft doesn't publish a 
detailed description of exactly how it creates its spreadsheet files.  There
are often "secret" ways of doing things that are only known to the 
developers within Microsoft.
Reverse engineering means looking at the way a program handles different 
kinds of files, and then trying to write a program that imitates what
the other program does.   
The end result of all this is that there are several ways
to get the data from spreadsheet files into R.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spreadsheets are organized as a collection of one or more sheets, stored in
a single file.   Each of the sheets represents a rectangular display of rows
and columns, not unlike a data frame.  Unfortunately, people often embed 
text, graphics and pictures into spreadsheets, so it's not a good idea to 
assume that a spreadsheet has the consistent structure of a data frame or 
matrix, even if portions of it do appear to have that structure.  In addition,
spreadsheets often have a large amount of header information (more than just
a list of variable names), sometimes making it challenging to figure out 
the correct variable names to use for the different columns in the spreadsheet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our main concern will be in getting the information from the spreadsheet into 
R:
we won't look at how to work with data within Excel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you are simply working with a single Excel spreadsheet, the easiest way
to get it into R is to open the spreadsheet with any compatible program, go
to the File menu, and select Save As.  When the file selector dialog appears,
notice that you will be given an option of different file format choices,
usually through a drop down menu.  Choose something like "Tab delimited text",
or "CSV (Comma separated values)".  If any of the fields in the spreadsheet
contain commas, tab delimited is a better choice, but generally it doesn't
matter which one you use.    Now, the file is (more or less) ready to 
be read into R, using <tt>read.csv</tt> or <tt>read.delim</tt>.  A very common
occurence is for fields stored in a spreadsheet to contain either single 
or double quotes, in which case the <tt>quote=</tt> argument can be used to
make sure R understands what you want.   Spreadsheets often arrange their
data so that there are a different number of valid entries on different lines,
which will confuse <tt>read.table</tt>; the <tt>fill=</tt> argument may be of
use in these cases.  Finally, as mentioned previously, there are often multiple
descriptive lines of text at the top of a spreadsheet, so some experimentation
with the <tt>skip=</tt> argument to <tt>read.table</tt> may be necessary.
Alternatively, you can simply delete those lines from the file into which 
you save the tab- or comma-delimited data.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As you can see, this is a somewhat time-consuming process which needs to be
customized for each spreadsheet.   It's further complicated by the fact that
it only handles one sheet of a multi-sheet spreadsheet; in those cases the 
process would need to be repeated for each sheet.  If you need to read a
number of spreadsheets, especially ones where you need to access the data from
more than one sheet, you need to use a more programmable solution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
R provides several methods to read spreadsheets without having to save them as
tab- or comma-delimited files.  The first is the <tt>read.xls</tt> function
in the <tt>gdata</tt> library.  This function uses a Perl program (included
as part of the library), that converts the spreadsheet to a comma-separated
file, and then uses <tt>read.csv</tt> to convert it to a data frame.  
In order for this library to work, perl must also be installed on 
the computer that's running R.  perl will be installed on virtually any
Unix-based computer (including Mac OSX), but will most likely not be on
most Windows computers (although once perl is installed on a Windows system, the 
<tt>read.xls</tt> function will work with no problems).  However there
is a Windows-only package , <tt>xlsReadWrite</tt>, available from CRAN
which can both read and write Excel files.  (On other platforms, the 
<tt>dataframes2xls</tt> package provides a <tt>write.xls</tt> function.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another method utilizes a facility known as ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity),
which is a method that allows different programs that handle data to communicate 
with each other.  The ODBC interface uses a query language known as SQL, which
we'll study later, so for now I'll just describe the use of <tt>read.xls</tt>.
(Remember, for just one or two data tables from a spreadsheet, saving as a 
tab- or comma-delimited
file and using the correct <tt>read.table</tt> variant will usually be the 
easiest route. )

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since <tt>read.xls</tt> does nothing more than convert the spreadsheet to 
comma-separated form and then call <tt>read.csv</tt>, the guidelines for 
using it are very similar to the normal use of <tt>read.csv</tt>.  The 
most useful feature of <tt>read.xls</tt> is that it accepts an optional
<tt>sheet=</tt> argument, allowing multiple sheets from a spreadsheet file to 
be automatically read.
