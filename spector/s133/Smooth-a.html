1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothers</h2>
    In many of the graphs we've looked at, we added a straight line representing the 
best linear regression line that went through the data we were plotting.  Such lines can 
be very helpful when there are lots of points, or when outliers might detract from our
seeing a relationship among the points.
    But plotting the best linear regression line has some limitations.  For one thing,
the regression has to fit all the data, so finding a good regression fit is often a 
compromise between being true to the data in any given range, and trying to come up with
a single line that does reasonably well throughout the entire range.  For some data, this
may be appropriate.  For example, if we know that two variables really follow a linear
relationship, then we'd have to assume that deviations from that relationship are just 
noise, and the best straight line would be a meaningful way to display their relationship
on a graph.  However, situations like that are not that common.
    To come up with a way of visualizing relationships between two variables without
resorting to a regression lines, statisticians and mathematicians have developed 
techniques for smoothing curves.  Essentially this means drawing lines through the points 
based only on other points from the surrounding neighborhood, not from the entire set of 
points.   
    There are many different types of smoothers available, and most of them offer an 
option that controls how much smoothing they will do as well as options to control the 
basic methods that they use, so it's usually possible to find
a smoother that will work well for a particular set of data.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kernel Smoothers</h2>
   Kernel smoothers work by forming a weighted average of all the y-values corresponding 
to points whose x-values are close to the x-value of a point being plotted.  The 
function that defines the weights is known as a kernel, and the number of points involved
in the weighted average is based on a parameter known as the bandwidth.   The default 
kernel is a box function; in other words, it simply averages together y-values which are 
within the specified bandwidth of a given x-value, and uses that average as the y-value
for the x-value in question.  With a very tiny bandwidth, this corresponds to a 
"connect-the-dots" type of drawing.  With a very large bandwidth, it will basically
estimate every y-value as the mean of all the y-values.  However, even when the bandwidth
is carefully chosen, using the box kernel rarely will result in a truly smooth graph.
For example, consider a plot of <tt>OD.Ratio</tt> versus <tt>Proanthocyanins</tt> from 
the <tt>wine</tt> data set that we've used in previous examples.  The following code
produces a plot of the variables, and superimposes a line representing a box kernel
smooth with the default bandwidth:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;plot(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio)
&#62;&nbsp;lines(ksmooth(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio))

</pre>
Here's the graph:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="winebox.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Notice how choppy the line is, especially where there isn't much data.  That's because 
the box kernel is too extreme - it either adds in a point or not.   So using the box
kernel is like stacking up a bunch of square boxes around each point, and we don't really
get a smooth result.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
More commonly, kernels will have a maximum at distances that are very small, and will
decrease gradually as the (absolute value) of the distance from the center of the 
kernel increases.  This means that nearby points will have lots of influence on the 
weighted estimate that will be plotted, but as we move away from a particular point,
the neighboring points will have less and less influence.  We can modify how many 
points are considered through the bandwidth - including more points tends to give
smoother curves that don't respond as well to local variation, while decreasing the 
bandwidth tends to make the curve look "choppier".  One of the most common kernels
used in smoothing is the Gaussian or normal kernel.  This kernel is the familiar 
"bell curve" - largest in the middle (corresponding in this cases to distances of 
zero from a particular point), and gradually decreasing over it's supported range.
The width of that range is determined by the bandwith when using a kernel smoother.
Here's the <tt>Proanthocyanins</tt> vs. <tt>OD.Ratio</tt> plot, smoothed with a
normal kernel using the default bandwidth:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="winenorm.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Notice the change in the line when switching to the <tt>normal</tt> kernel; the line
is now smooth, and we can see that a linear relationship that holds up until around
a <tt>Proanthocyanin</tt> concentration of about 2.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The argument that controls the size of the neighborhood that's used 
by <tt>ksmooth</tt>
to estimate
the smoothed value at each point is called <tt>bandwidth</tt>.  We can examine 
the effect of changing the bandwidth as follows;

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
kplotfn&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(bw){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio,main=bw)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lines(ksmooth(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio,bandwidth=bw),col='green')
}

bws&nbsp;=&nbsp;seq(.1,1,by=.1)
par(mfrow=c(5,2),mar=c(2,4,2,1)+.1)
sapply(bws,kplotfn)

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="winek.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After adjusting the margins, the plot we got looks something like a lattice plot.
But how could we produce an actual lattice plot with this data?  We would need 
a data frame with x and y values for each bandwidth.  What does <tt>ksmooth</tt>
return?

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;result&nbsp;=&nbsp;ksmooth(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio)
&#62;&nbsp;class(result)
[1]&nbsp;"list"
&#62;&nbsp;names(result)
[1]&nbsp;"x"&nbsp;"y"

</pre>
 Since the lengths of <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> must be equal, we 
can convert the output to a data frame directly.  Let's write a function which
will generate a data frame with <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and <tt>bandwidth</tt>
values for a single bandwidth:

<pre>
kfun&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(bw)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data.frame(bw=bw,as.data.frame(ksmooth(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio,bandwidth=bw)))

</pre>
 Notice that R realized it had to repeat the single <tt>bw</tt> value
to make it compatible with <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  As always, we should test
the function:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;result&nbsp;=&nbsp;kfun(.5)
&#62;&nbsp;head(result)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bw&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y
1&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;0.4100000&nbsp;1.881429
2&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;0.4279096&nbsp;1.881429
3&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;0.4458192&nbsp;1.812500
4&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;0.4637288&nbsp;1.812500
5&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;0.4816384&nbsp;1.879000
6&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;0.4995480&nbsp;1.879000

</pre>
 Now we can create a list of data frames, one for each bandwidth:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;frames&nbsp;=&nbsp;lapply(seq(.1,1,by=.1),kfun)
&#62;&nbsp;allbws&nbsp;=&nbsp;do.call(rbind,frames)
&#62;&nbsp;dim(allbws)
[1]&nbsp;1780&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3

</pre>
 Notice the use of the <tt>do.call</tt> function, which is used here
to call <tt>rbind</tt> with the data frames for all of the different bandwidths.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To get both points and lines on each panel, we can create a custom panel function:

<pre>
mypanel&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(x,y,...){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel.xyplot(wine$Proanthocyanins,wine$OD.Ratio);
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel.xyplot(x,y,type='l',col='red')
}
xyplot(y~x|factor(bw),data=allbws,type='l',as.table=TRUE,layout=c(2,5),panel=mypanel)

</pre>
The resulting plot appears below:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally Weighted Regression Smoothers</h2>
Another approach that is often used to smooth curves is locally weighted regression.
Instead of taking a weighted average of y-values near the x-values we want to plot,
the nearby points are used in a (usually quadratic) weighted regression, and predicted 
values from these local regressions are used as the y-values that are plotted. 
The <tt>lowess</tt> function in R implements this technique by using the reciprocal
of the residuals of successive fits as the weights, downgrading those points that 
don't contribute to a smooth fit.  In the <tt>lowess</tt> function, the argument 
<tt>f=</tt> specifies the fraction of the data to be used in the local regressions.
Specifying a larger value results in a smoother curve.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To illustrate, consider a plot of <tt>literacy</tt> versus <tt>phys</tt>, the number
of physicians per 100000 people, from the <tt>world</tt> data set that we've used in
previous examples.  The following code produces a plot of the data with a lowess 
smoothed curve superimposed:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;plot(world$literacy,world$phys)
&#62;&nbsp;lines(lowess(world$literacy,world$phys))

</pre>
 The graph appears below:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="worldlo.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The argument to <tt>lowess</tt> that controls the level of smoothing is <tt>f</tt>,
the fraction of the data which will be used in the local regressions.
Let's compare the results of smoothing the literacy/physician curve using different 
values of <tt>f</tt>

<pre>
lplotfn&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(f){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot(world$literacy,world$phys,main=f)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lines(lowess(world$literacy,world$phys,f=f),col='orange')
}

fs&nbsp;=&nbsp;seq(.1,1,by=.1)
par(mfrow=c(5,2),mar=c(2,4,2,1)+.1)
sapply(fs,lplotfn)

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For this particular data set, there's not much difference in the 
appearance of the smoothed curve, although there is a bit of noise
when using the lowest value of <tt>f</tt>
