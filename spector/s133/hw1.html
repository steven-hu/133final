<div class="p"><!----></div>
Data was collected by  loop detectors at one particular location of eastbound 
Interstate 80 in Sacramento, California. There are six columns and 1740 rows 
in the data set. The rows correspond to successive five minute intervals from 
March 14 to 20, 2003, where the data values in a row report the flow (number of cars) 
and occupancy (the proportion of time there was a car over the loop) in each 
of three lanes on the freeway. Lane 1 is the leftmost lane, lane 2 is in the 
center, and lane 3 is the rightmost.  The data set can be found at
<a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/flow-occ.csv">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/flow-occ.csv</a>
The original data are from the 
Freeway Performance Measurement System (PEMS) website
(<a href="http://pems.eecs.berkeley.edu/Public/">Freeway Performance Measurement System (PEMS) website</a>)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li> Read the data in R.  Note that you don't need to actually download
the data in order to read it.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>  Is there a particular lane for which the flow of traffic is consistently higher 
than the other lanes?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Is there a relationship between flow and occupancy?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

The data for this problem was provided by John Rice of the UC Berkeley statistics 
department.

<font size="+2">Ages of United States Senators</font></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A lot of excitement was generated when Barack Obama was elected president because
of his youth.  Does the same trend in age hold in the United States Senate?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/senate.txt">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/senate.txt</a> is a tab-separated file with the following columns, recorded for each past and present United States senator: 
<tt>Name</tt>, the name of the senator;
<tt>start</tt>, the first year that the senator served in office; <tt>end</tt>, the last year 
they served; <tt>State</tt>, the state from which they were elected; <tt>Party</tt>, their
political party, and <tt>Birthday</tt>, when they were born.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Plot the average age of the senators against time, for all the 
years of available data.  The start and end years are recorded so that
a senator is active if the year in question is 
greater than or equal to the start year and less than or equal to the end year.
Are senators getting younger over time?

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<font size="+2">Temperatures in Berkeley in January</font></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In my backyard, I have a temperature sensor attached to a computer which records
the temperature every fifteen minutes.  I've extracted the minimum, mean  and maximum
temperature for each day in January over the last seven years into <br />
<a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/january.tab">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/january.tab</a>.  The columns are <tt>min</tt>, the minimum
temperature for the day; <tt>mean</tt>, the average of all 96 temperaures for the day;
<tt>max</tt>, the maximum temperature for the day;
<tt>year</tt>; and <tt>day</tt>.  Remember that this data is only for the last
seven Januaries.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li>Over the last seven years, which year had the hottest January?  Which year 
had the coldest?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
The computer to which the sensor is connected was broken for a few days in
January one year.  Which year was it?  Explain how you found the answer -
simply examining the data by eye is not acceptable.
