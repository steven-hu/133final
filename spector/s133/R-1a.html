 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Data in R</h2>
While R can handle many types of data, the three main varieties that 
we'll be using are numeric, character and logical.  
In R, you can identify
what type of object you're dealing with by using the <tt>mode</tt> function.
For example:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;name&nbsp;=&nbsp;'phil'
&#62;&nbsp;number&nbsp;=&nbsp;495
&#62;&nbsp;happy&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE
&#62;&nbsp;mode(name)
[1]&nbsp;"character"
&#62;&nbsp;mode(number)
[1]&nbsp;"numeric"
&#62;&nbsp;mode(happy)
[1]&nbsp;"logical"

</pre>
Note that when we enter character data, it needs to be surrounded by 
quotes (either double or single), but the symbols <tt>TRUE</tt> and 
<tt>FALSE</tt> (without quotes) are recognized as values of a logical
variable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another important characteristic of an object in R is its class, because
many functions know how to treat objects of different classes in a special
way.  You can find the class of an object with the <tt>class</tt> function.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vectors</h2>
Occasionally it may be useful to have a variable (like <tt>name</tt> or
<tt>happy</tt> in the above example) to have only a single value (like
<tt>'phil'</tt> or <tt>TRUE</tt>), but usually we'll want to store more
than a single value (sometimes refered to as a scalar) in a variable.
A vector is a collection of objects, all of the same mode, that can be
stored in a single variable, and accessed through subscripts.  For example,
consider the minimum temperature in Berkeley for the first 10 days of 
January, 2006:

<pre>
50.7&nbsp;52.8&nbsp;48.6&nbsp;53.0&nbsp;49.9&nbsp;47.9&nbsp;54.1&nbsp;47.6&nbsp;43.6&nbsp;45.5

</pre>
We could create a variable called mintemp as follows:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;mintemp&nbsp;=&nbsp;c(50.7,52.8,48.6,53.0,49.9,47.9,54.1,47.6,43.6,45.5)

</pre>
The <tt>c</tt> function is short for catenate or combine, and it's used to put
individual values together into vectors.    You can find the number of 
elements in a vector using the <tt>length</tt> function.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once you've created a vector, you can refer to the elements of the vector 
using subscripts.  Numerical subscripts in R start at 1, and continue up
to the length of the vector.  Subscripts of 0 are silently ignored.  To refer to
multiple elements in a vector, simply use the <tt>c</tt> function to create 
a vector of the indexes you're interested in.  So to extract the first, third,
and fifth values of the <tt>mintemp</tt> vector, we could use:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;mintemp[c(1,3,5)]
[1]&nbsp;50.7&nbsp;48.6&nbsp;49.9

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If all of the subscripts of an object are negative, R will ignore those values,
and use just the remaining elements.  To extract all of the elements of 
<tt>mintemp</tt> except the first and last (tenth), use:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;mintemp[-c(1,10)]
[1]&nbsp;52.8&nbsp;48.6&nbsp;53.0&nbsp;49.9&nbsp;47.9&nbsp;54.1&nbsp;47.6&nbsp;43.6

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In most programming languages, once you're dealing with vectors, you also
have to start worrying about loops and other programming problems.  Not
so in R!  For example, suppose we want to use the conversion formula

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center" cellspacing="0"  cellpadding="2"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
C = 5/9 (F <font face="symbol">-</font
> 32)</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



to convert our Fahrenheit temperatures into Celsius.
We can act as if mintemp is just a single number, and R will do the hard 
part:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;mintempC&nbsp;=&nbsp;5/9&nbsp;*&nbsp;(mintemp&nbsp;-&nbsp;32)
&#62;&nbsp;mintempC
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;10.388889&nbsp;11.555556&nbsp;&nbsp;9.222222&nbsp;11.666667&nbsp;&nbsp;9.944444&nbsp;&nbsp;8.833333&nbsp;12.277778
&nbsp;[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;8.666667&nbsp;&nbsp;6.444444&nbsp;&nbsp;7.500000

</pre>
 In fact, most similar operations in R are vectorized; that is they
operate on entire vectors at once, without the need for loops or other 
programming.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are some shortcuts to generate vectors.  The colon operator lets you
generate sequences of integers from one value to another.  For example,

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1:10
&#62;&nbsp;x
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;10

</pre>
 For more control, see the help page for the <tt>seq</tt> function.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can repeat values using the <tt>rep</tt> function.  This function is
very flexible; if called with scalars, it does the obvious:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;rep(5,3)
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;5&nbsp;5&nbsp;5

</pre>
 with a vector and a scalar, it creates a new vector by repeating
the old one:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;3:7
&#62;&nbsp;rep(y,3)
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;5&nbsp;6&nbsp;7&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;5&nbsp;6&nbsp;7&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;5&nbsp;6&nbsp;7

</pre>
 Finally, if you call <tt>rep</tt> with two equal length vectors,
it repeats the elements of the first vector as many times as the corresponding
element of the second  vector:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;rep(1:4,c(2,3,3,4))
&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;3&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;4&nbsp;4&nbsp;4

</pre>
One surprising thing about vectors in R is that many times it will carry 
out an operation with two vectors that aren't the same size by simply 
recycling the values in the shorter vector.  For example, suppose we 
try to add a vector with four numbers to one with just two numbers:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;c(1,2,3,4)&nbsp;+&nbsp;c(1,2)
[1]&nbsp;2&nbsp;4&nbsp;4&nbsp;6

</pre>
Notice that, for the two last elements, it simply recycled the 1 and 2 
from the second vector to perform the addition.  R will be silent when
things like this happen, but if the length of the larger vector isn't an
even multiple of the length of the smaller vector, R will print a warning:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;c(1,2,3,4)&nbsp;+&nbsp;c(1,2,3)
[1]&nbsp;2&nbsp;4&nbsp;6&nbsp;5
Warning&nbsp;message:
longer&nbsp;object&nbsp;length&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;a&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;of&nbsp;shorter&nbsp;object&nbsp;
length&nbsp;in:&nbsp;c(1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4)&nbsp;+&nbsp;c(1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3)

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's possible to provide names for the elements of a vector.
Suppose we were working with purchases in a number of states, and we
needed to know the sales tax rate for a given state.  We could create
a named vector as follows:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate&nbsp;=&nbsp;c(AL=4,CA=7.25,IL=6.25,KS=5.3,NY=4.25,TN=7)
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate
&nbsp;&nbsp;AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TN
4.00&nbsp;7.25&nbsp;6.25&nbsp;5.30&nbsp;4.25&nbsp;7.00

</pre>
  To add names to a vector after a fact,  you can use the 
<tt>names</tt> function:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate&nbsp;=&nbsp;c(4,7.25,6.25,5.3,4.25,7)
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate
[1]&nbsp;4.00&nbsp;7.25&nbsp;6.25&nbsp;5.30&nbsp;4.25&nbsp;7.00
&#62;&nbsp;names(taxrate)&nbsp;=&nbsp;c('AL','CA','IL','KS','NY','TN')
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate
&nbsp;&nbsp;AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TN
4.00&nbsp;7.25&nbsp;6.25&nbsp;5.30&nbsp;4.25&nbsp;7.00

</pre>
 If you have a named vector, you can access the elements with 
either numeric subscripts or by using the name of the element you want:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate[3]
&nbsp;&nbsp;IL
6.25
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate['KS']
&nbsp;&nbsp;KS
5.3

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of the most powerful tools in R is the ability to use logical expressions
to extract or modify elements in the way that numeric subscripts 
are traditionally used.  While there are (of course) many cases where we're
interested in accessing information based on the numeric or character 
subscript of an object, being able to use logical expressions gives us a 
much wider choice in the way we can study our data.   For example, suppose
we want to find all of observations in <tt>taxrate</tt> with a taxrate less
than 6.  First, let's look at the result of just asking whether 
<tt>taxrate</tt> is less than 6:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TN
&nbsp;TRUE&nbsp;FALSE&nbsp;FALSE&nbsp;&nbsp;TRUE&nbsp;&nbsp;TRUE&nbsp;FALSE

</pre>
 The result is a logical vector of the same length as the vector
we were asking about.   If we use such a vector to extract values from 
the <tt>taxrate</tt> vector, it will give us all the ones that correspond
to <tt>TRUE</tt> values, discarding the ones that correspond to <tt>FALSE</tt>.

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate[taxrate&nbsp;&#62;&nbsp;6]
&nbsp;&nbsp;CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TN
7.25&nbsp;6.25&nbsp;7.00

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another important use of logical variables is counting the number of elements
of a vector meet a particular condition.  When a logical vector is passed
to the <tt>sum</tt> function, <tt>TRUE</tt>s count as one and <tt>FALSE</tt>s
count as 0.  So we can count the number of <tt>TRUE</tt>s in a logical 
expression by passing it to <tt>sum</tt>:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;sum(taxrate&nbsp;&#62;&nbsp;6)
[1]&nbsp;3

</pre>
 This tells us three observations in the <tt>taxrate</tt> vector
had values greater than 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As another example, suppose we want to find which of the states we have 
information about has the highest sales tax.  The <tt>max</tt> function will
find the largest value in a vector.  (Once again, note that we don't have 
to worry about the size of the vector or looping over individual elements.)

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;max(taxrate)
[1]&nbsp;7.25

</pre>
We can find the state which has the highest tax rate as follows:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;taxrate[taxrate&nbsp;==&nbsp;max(taxrate)]
&nbsp;&nbsp;CA
7.25

</pre>
Notice that we use two equal signs when testing for equality, and one 
equal sign when we are assigning an object to a variable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another useful tool for these kinds of queries is the <tt>which</tt>
function.  It converts between logical subscripts and numeric ones.
For example, if we wanted to know the index of the element in the 
<tt>taxrate</tt> vector that was the biggest, we could use:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;which(taxrate&nbsp;==&nbsp;max(taxrate))
CA
&nbsp;2

</pre>
  In fact, this is such a common operation that R provides
two functions called <tt>which.min</tt> and <tt>which.max</tt> which
will return the index of the minimum or maximum element of a vector:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;which.max(taxrate)
CA&nbsp;
&nbsp;2&nbsp;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While it's certainly not necessary to examine every function that 
we use in R, it might be interesting to see what <tt>which.max</tt>
is doing beyond our straight-forward solution.  As always, we can 
type the name of the function to see what it does:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;which.max
function&nbsp;(x)&nbsp;
.Internal(which.max(x))
&lt;environment:&nbsp;namespace:base&#62;

</pre>
 <tt>.Internal</tt> means that the function that actually finds
the index of the maximum value is compiled inside of R.  Generally functions
like this will be faster than pure R solutions like the first one we tried.
We can use the <tt>system.time</tt> function to see how much faster 
<tt>which.max</tt> will be.  Because functions use the equal sign (<tt>=</tt>)
to name their arguments, we'll use the alternative assignment operator, 
<tt>&lt;-</tt> in our call to system.time:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(one&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;which(taxrate&nbsp;==&nbsp;max(taxrate)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;

</pre>
 It's not surprising to see a time of 0 when operating on such
a small vector.  It doesn't mean that it required no time to do the operation,
just that the amount of time it required was smaller than the granularity
of the system clock.  (The granularity of the clock is simply the smallest
interval of time that can be measured by the computer.)  To get a good 
comparison, we'll need to create a larger vector.  To do this, we'll use
the <tt>rnorm</tt> function, which generates random numbers from the normal
distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  To get times that we
can trust, I'll use a vector with 10 million elements:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;rnorm(10000000)
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(one&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;which(x&nbsp;==&nbsp;max(x)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.276&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.292&nbsp;
&#62;&nbsp;system.time(two&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;which.max(x))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user&nbsp;&nbsp;system&nbsp;elapsed&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.068&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.071&nbsp;

</pre>
 While the pure R solution seems pretty fast (0.292 seconds to
find the index of the largest element in a vector of 10 million numbers),
the compiled (internal) version is actually around 4 times faster!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course none of this matters if they don't get the same answers:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;one
[1]&nbsp;8232773
&#62;&nbsp;two
[1]&nbsp;8232773

</pre>
 The two methods do agree.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you try this example on your own computer, you'll see a different value
for the index of the maximum.  This is due to the way random numbers are 
generated in R, and we'll see how to take more control of this later in the
semester.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
