1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spline Smoothers</h2>
Another type of smoothing is known as spline smoothing, named after a tool formerly
used by draftsmen.  A spline is a flexible piece of metal (usually lead) which could
be used as a guide for drawing smooth curves.  A set of points (known as knots) would
be selected, and the spline would be held down at a particular x,y point, then bent to
go through the next point, and so on.  Due to the flexibility of the metal, this 
process would result in a smooth curve through the points.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mathematically, the process can be reproduced by choosing the knot points and using 
(usually cubic) regression to estimate points in between the knots, and using calculus 
to make sure that the curve is smooth whenever the individual regression lines are
joined together.   
The <tt>smooth.spline</tt> function in R performs these operations.
The degree of smoothness is controlled by an argument called <tt>spar=</tt>, which 
usually ranges between 0 and 1.
To illustrate, consider a data set consisting of the wheat production of the United 
States from 1910 to 2004.  The data set can be found at
<a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wheat.txt">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wheat.txt</a>.
The following lines will produce a plot of the data, and superimpose a spline smooth.

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;wheat&nbsp;=&nbsp;read.table('http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/wheat.txt',header=TRUE)
&#62;&nbsp;plot(wheat$year,wheat$production)
&#62;&nbsp;lines(smooth.spline(wheat$year,wheat$production))

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here's the result:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="wheatspl.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The amount of smoothing that <tt>smooth.spline</tt> applies is controlled by 
the argument <tt>spar</tt>.  We can examine the effect of <tt>spar</tt> by 
producing several plots, each with a different value of <tt>spar</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
plotfn&nbsp;=&nbsp;function(spar){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot(wheat$year,wheat$production,main=spar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lines(smooth.spline(wheat$year,wheat$production,spar=spar),col='red')
}
spars&nbsp;=&nbsp;seq(.1,1,by=.1)
par(mfrow=c(5,2),mar=c(2,4,2,1)+.1)
sapply(spars,plotfn)

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The plot appears below:

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Supersmoother</h2>
While most smoothers require specification of a bandwidth, fraction of data, or level
of smoothing, supersmoother is different in that it figures these things out for 
itself.  Thus, it's an excellent choice for situations where smoothing needs to be done
without any user intervention.  Supersmoother works by performing lots of simple 
local regression smooths, and, at each x-value it uses those smooths to decide the best 
y-value to use.  In R, supersmoother is made available through the <tt>supsmu</tt> 
function.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To illustrate, consider the car data which we used earlier when we were studying 
cluster analysis.  The following lines produce a plot of <tt>weight</tt> 
versus <tt>MPG</tt>, and superimposes a supersmoother line.

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;plot(cars$Weight,cars$MPG)
&#62;&nbsp;lines(supsmu(cars$Weight,cars$MPG))

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The plot appears below:

3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothers with Lattice Plots</h2>
When working with lattice graphics, we've already seen the use of <tt>panel.lmline</tt>,
which displays the best regression line in each panel of a lattice plot.  A similar 
function, <tt>panel.loess</tt>, is available to superimpose a locally weighted regression
smoother in each panel of a plot.  As a simple illustration, consider the built-in
<tt>Orange</tt> data set, which has information about the age and circumference of 
several orange trees.  First, let's look at a plot with the best regression line 
smoother superimposed on the plot of <tt>age</tt> versus <tt>circumference</tt> for
each <tt>Tree</tt>:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;library(lattice)
&#62;&nbsp;xyplot(circumference~age|Tree,data=Orange,
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel=function(x,y,...){panel.xyplot(x,y,...);panel.lmline(x,y,...)})

</pre>
Here's the plot:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/spector/s133/orangelm.png.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To create the same plot, but using the <tt>panel.loess</tt> function, we can use 
the following:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;xyplot(circumference~age|Tree,data=Orange,&nbsp;
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel=function(x,y,...){panel.xyplot(x,y,...);panel.loess(x,y,...)})

</pre>
Here's  how the plot looks:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<img src="orangelo.png">

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If a <tt>panel.</tt> function doesn't exist for a smoother you'd like to use,
you can use the <tt>panel.lines</tt> function to plot it directly:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;xyplot(circumference~age|Tree,data=Orange,&nbsp;
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel=function(x,y,...){panel.xyplot(x,y,...);z=supsmu(x,y);panel.lines(z$x,z$y,...)})

</pre>
In this case supersmoother came closer to a straight line than lowess.
