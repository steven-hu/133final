1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tagging and Backreferences</h2>
Consider again the problem of looking for email addresses.  The regular 
expression that we wrote is exactly what we want, because we don't care
what's surrounding the email address.  But in many cases, the only way
we can find what we want is to specify the surroundings of what we're 
looking for.   Suppose we wish to write a program that will find all of
the links  (URLs that can be reached by clicking some text on the page)
of a web page.  A line containing a link may look something like this:

<pre>
&lt;a&nbsp;href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu"&#62;UC&nbsp;Berkeley&nbsp;Stat&nbsp;Dept&nbsp;Home&nbsp;Page&lt;/a&#62;&lt;br&nbsp;/&#62;

</pre>
  Finding the links is very easy; but our goal here is to extract 
the links themselves.  Notice that there's no regular expression that can
match just the link; we need to use some information about the context in
which it's found, and when we extract the matched expression there will be 
extra characters that we really don't want.  To handle this problem, 
parentheses can be used to surround parts of a regular expression that we're
really interested in, and tools exist to help us get those parts separated
from the overall expression.  In R, the only functions that can deal with 
these tagged expressions are <tt>sub</tt> and <tt>gsub</tt>, so to take 
take advantage of them, you may have to first extract the regular expressions
with the methods we've already seen, and then apply <tt>sub</tt> or 
<tt>gsub</tt>.  To illustrate, let's compose a simple regular expression
to find links.  
I don't need to worry about the case of the regular expression, because the <tt>grep</tt>, 
<tt>sub</tt>, <tt>gsub</tt> and <tt>gregexpr</tt> functions all 
support the <tt>ignore.case=</tt> argument.
Notice that I've surrounded the part we want (<tt>[^"'&gt;]+</tt>) in parentheses.
This will allow me to refer to this tagged expression as <tt>\1</tt> in a 
call to <tt>gsub</tt>.  (Additional tagged expressions will be refered to 
as <tt>\2</tt>, <tt>\3</tt>, etc.)
Using this
pattern, we can first find all the chunks of text that have our links 
embedded in them, and then use <tt>gsub</tt> to change the entire piece to
just the part we want:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;link&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&lt;a&nbsp;href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu"&#62;UC&nbsp;Berkeley&nbsp;Stat&nbsp;Dept&nbsp;Home&nbsp;Page&lt;/a&#62;&lt;br&nbsp;/&#62;'
&#62;&nbsp;gregout&nbsp;=&nbsp;gregexpr('href&nbsp;*=&nbsp;*["\']?([^"\'&#62;]+)["\']?&nbsp;*&#62;',link,ignore.case=TRUE)
&#62;&nbsp;thematch&nbsp;=&nbsp;mapply(getexpr,link,gregout)
&#62;&nbsp;answer&nbsp;=&nbsp;gsub('href&nbsp;*=&nbsp;*["\']?([^"\'&#62;]+)["\']?&nbsp;*&#62;','\\1',thematch,ignore.case=TRUE)
&#62;&nbsp;names(answer)&nbsp;=&nbsp;NULL

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Text into R</h2>
Up until now, we've been working with text that's already been formatted to make
it easy for R to read, and <tt>scan</tt> or <tt>read.table</tt> (and its associated 
wrapper  functions) have been sufficient to take care of things.  Now we want to
treat our input as raw text; in other words, we don't want R to assume that the data
is in any particular form.  The main function for taking care of this in R is 
<tt>readLines</tt>.  In the simplest form, you pass <tt>readLines</tt> the name 
of a URL or file that you want to read, and it returns a character vector with one
element for each line of the file or url, containing the contents of each line.
An optional argument to <tt>readLines</tt> specifies the number of lines you want
to read; by default it's set to <tt>-1</tt>, which means to read all available
lines.
<tt>readLines</tt> removes the newline at the end of each line, but otherwise returns the text exactly the way it was found in the file or URL.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>readLines</tt> also accepts connections, which are objects in R that represent
an alternative form of input, such as a pipe or a zipped file.  Take a look at 
the help file for <tt>connections</tt> for more information on this capability.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For moderate-sized problems that aren't too complex, using <tt>readLines</tt> in
its default mode (reading all the lines of input into a vector of character 
strings) will usually be the best way to solve your problem, because most of the 
functions you'll use with such data are vectorized, and can operate on every line
at once.  
As a simple example,
suppose we wanted to get 
the names of all the files containing notes for this class.  A glance at the 
page <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/schedule.html">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/schedule.html</a>
indicates that all the online notes can be found on lines like this one:

<pre>
&lt;tr&#62;&lt;td&#62;&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;23&nbsp;&lt;/td&#62;&lt;td&#62;&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;href="Unix.html"&#62;Introduction&nbsp;to&nbsp;UNIX&lt;/a&#62;&lt;/td&#62;&lt;/tr&#62;

</pre>
 We can easily extract the names of the note files using the 
<tt>sub</tt> function (since there is only one link per line, we don't 
need to use <tt>gsub</tt>, although we could).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first step is to create a vector of character strings that will represents
the lines of the URL we are trying to read.  We can simply pass the URL name
to <tt>readLines</tt>:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;readLines('http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/schedule.html')

</pre>
Next, we can write a regular expression that can find the links.  
Note that the pattern that we want (i.e. the name of the file referenced 
in the link) has been tagged with parentheses for later extraction.
By using
the caret (<tt>^</tt>) and dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>) we can describe our pattern
as an entire line - when we substitute the tagged expression for the 
pattern we'll have just what we want.  I'll also add the basename of the 
files so that they could be, for example, entered into a browser.

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;baseurl&nbsp;=&nbsp;'http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133'
&#62;&nbsp;linkpat&nbsp;=&nbsp;'^.*&lt;td&#62;&nbsp;*&lt;a&nbsp;href=["\'](.*)["\']&#62;.*$'
&#62;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;readLines('http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/schedule.html')
&#62;&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;grep(linkpat,x,value=TRUE)
&#62;&nbsp;paste(baseurl,sub(linkpat,'\\1',y),sep='/')
