<title> Saving Plots in R</title>
 
<h1 align="center">Saving Plots in R </h1>

Since R runs on so many different operating systems, and supports 
so many different graphics formats, it's not surprising that there
are a variety of ways of saving your plots, depending on what 
operating system you are using, what you plan to do with the graph,
and whether you're connecting locally or remotely.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first step in deciding how to save plots is to decide on the 
output format that you want to use.  The following table lists some
of the available formats, along with guidance as to when they may
be useful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>Format</td><td>Driver</td><td>Notes</td></tr>
<tr><td>JPG</td><td><tt>jpeg</tt></td><td>Can be used anywhere, but doesn't resize</td></tr>
<tr><td>PNG</td><td><tt>png</tt></td><td>Can be used anywhere, but doesn't resize</td></tr>
<tr><td>WMF</td><td><tt>win.metafile</tt></td><td>Windows only; best choice with Word; easily resizable</td></tr>
<tr><td>PDF</td><td><tt>pdf</tt></td><td>Best choice with pdflatex; easily resizable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Postscript</td><td><tt>postscript</tt></td><td>Best choice with latex and Open Office; easily resizable</td></tr></table>

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A General Method</h2>
First, here's a general method that will work on any computer with R,
regardless of operating system or the way that you are connecting.

<ol type="1">
<li>Choose the format that you want to use.  In this example, I'll save a 
plot as a JPG file, so I'll use the <tt>jpeg</tt> driver.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
The only argument that the device drivers need is the name of the file 
that you will use to save your graph.  Remember that your plot will be
stored relative to the current directory.  You can find the current 
directory by typing <tt>getwd()</tt> at the R prompt.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may want to make adjustments to the size of the plot before saving
it.  Consult the help file for your selected driver to learn how.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Now enter your plotting commands as you normally would.  You will
<b>not</b> actually see the plot - the commands are being saved to 
a file instead.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
When you're done with your plotting commands, enter the <tt>dev.off()</tt>
command.  This is very important - without it you'll get a partial plot
or nothing at all.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So if I wanted to save a jpg file called "<tt>rplot.jpg</tt>" containing
a plot of <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, I would type the following commands:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;jpeg('rplot.jpg')
&#62;&nbsp;plot(x,y)
&#62;&nbsp;dev.off()

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Approach</h2>
If you follow the process in the previous section, you'll first have to
make a plot to the screen, then re-enter the commands to save your plot
to a file.  R also provides the <tt>dev.copy</tt> command, to copy the 
contents of the graph window to a file without having to re-enter the 
commands.  For most plots, things will be fine, but sometimes translating
what was on the screen into a different format doesn't look as nice as
it should.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To use this approach, first produce your graph in the usual way.  When
you're happy with the way it looks, call <tt>dev.copy</tt>, passing it the
driver you want to use, the file name to store it in, and any other arguments
appropriate to the driver.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, to create a png file called <tt>myplot.png</tt> from a graph that 
is displayed by R, type

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;dev.copy(png,'myplot.png')
&#62;&nbsp;dev.off()

</pre>
 Remember that when you save plots this way, the plot isn't actually
written to the file until you call <tt>dev.off</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Sessions with Windows or OS X</h2>
If you're actually sitting in front of a Windows or Mac computer (i.e. not
using ssh to connect), the graphical user interface makes it easy to save
files.   Under Windows, right click inside the graph window, and choose
either "<tt>Save as metafile ...</tt>" or "<tt>Save as postscript ...</tt>"
If using Word, make sure to save as a metafile.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On a Mac, click on the graphics window to make sure it's the active one, then
go to <tt>File -&#62; Save</tt> in the menubar, and choose a location to save the
file.   It will be saved as a pdf file, which you can double click to open in
Preview, and then use the <tt>File -&#62; Save As</tt> menu choice to convert to
another format.
