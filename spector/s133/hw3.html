<li>At the web site <a href="http://www.fao.org/es/esc/prices/PricesServlet.jsp?lang=en">http://www.fao.org/es/esc/prices/PricesServlet.jsp?lang=en</a> 
is an applet that allows you to download data for prices of various commodities
over ranges in time.  Note that you can make multiple choices of commodities and dates by pressing 
the control key while clicking on the choices, or by clicking on a first choice and shift-clicking
on a final choice.  You can
copy the link to the CSV file that appears after you click 'Submit Query' to download directly
into R, or download the CSV file to your computer in the usual way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Choose between four and eight commodities of interest, and download the 
monthly data for as many years as are available.  Convert the dates to 
one of R's date types, and plot each commodity's price over time in such a way
that it's easy to compare the changes in the different commodity's prices over time.

At the web site <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/HTML/FS_DATA/STAT-ABS/Toc_xls.htm">http://www.dof.ca.gov/HTML/FS_DATA/STAT-ABS/Toc_xls.htm</a>
are links to several Excel spreadsheets containing statistical information 
about California.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Choose a spreadsheet from that web page that interests you, download it, 
and read it into R using one of the methods presented in class.  You should
choose a spreadsheet that has at least one variable for every county in 
California.  Choose a suitable gradient, and divide the variable into a
reasonable number of groups, and create a map of California with the colors
of the gradient representing the value of the variable for each county.

I have placed a copy of the SQLite albums database that was used in lecture
at <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/albums.db">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/albums.db</a>.  Use the database to answer the following questions:

<ul>
<li>  List the names of the ten songs which appear the most times in the collection, along with the number of times they appear.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>  List the names of the ten artists who have the most albums in the collection,
along with the number of albums.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> List the names of the ten artists who have the most tracks in the collection,
along with the number of tracks.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> List the names of the ten artists who have the most total time (length) for
all their tracks in the collection, along with the total time.
<div class="p"><!----></div>

The next part of the assignment uses a baseball database which was 
downloaded from <a href="http://www.baseball-databank.org/">http://www.baseball-databank.org/</a>.  
You will need to access the MySQL server running on <tt>springer.berkeley.edu</tt>
using the username and password given in class, and, if you're not using an SCF
machine, you'll have to set up an SSH tunnel.
There are 25 data tables in the database, many of which you won't need 
to use.   Answer the following three questions using at least one data summary
and/or graph to support your answer.

<ol type="a">
<li>Which college has produced the baseball players with the highest batting average?
Batting average can be calculated by taking the number of hits (column <tt>H</tt> 
in the <tt>Batting</tt> table) and dividing by the number of at-bats 
(column <tt>AB</tt> in the <tt>Batting</tt> table).  You may want to eliminate 
players who have had fewer than, say, 50 at-bats from the calculations.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Do players who hit more home runs receive  higher salaries than players who hit 
fewer home runs?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Do players who have nick names (<tt>nameNick</tt> in the <tt>Master</tt> table)
tend to receive higher salaries than players that don't have nick names?
Can you think of a reason why this may be true?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Notice that for the last two questions it's important to take time into account.
In other words, you'll have to break down your analysis to handle each year 
separately.

Your submission should be contained in a <em>single</em> pdf file. 
Email this file to me<br />
(<tt>s133@stat.berkeley.edu</tt>), 
by 11:59PM (plus or minus a minute)
on the due date. Make certain to save a copy of your email submission.
