<br>
<a href='final2010.pdf'>Last year's final (pdf)</a>
<p>
<br>
The final will be held in our regular classroom (150 GSPP) on Tuesday, May 10
from 11:30-2:30PM  (although I don't anticipate anyone needing all three hours.)
Like the midterm, it will be closed book with no notes or computer.  Please 
bring a blue book to the exam.
<br>
<p>
<br>
Assignments 5 (due April 29) and 6 (due May 6) are available on the <a href='homework.html'>Homework page.<p>

<font color=red>Note:</font> If you can't load the tcltk library on
a Mac, the problem is most likely that tcltk itself (not the R library)
is not installed on your computer.   Download and install the 
<tt>tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg</tt> file from <a href="http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/tools/">this page</a>.
<br>
<p>

<font color=red>Note:</font> Some of the descriptions in the XMLTV file
are empty, which can confuse the <tt>xmlValue</tt> function. If you 
experience this problem, use a function like this instead of calling
<tt>xmlValue</tt> directly:
<br>
<br>
<tt>
getnull = function(x,var)if(length(x[[var]]) > 0)xmlValue(x[[var]]) else ''
</tt>
<br>
<p>
<font color=red>Note:</font> If you are having trouble reading the 
listings.xml.gz file (which contains five days of listings), you can
use <a href='listings2.xml.gz'>this file</a> which contains only
two days of listings. 
<br>
<p>
<font color=red>Note:</font> If you are using Windows, and can't find
a working copy of the XML package, you can install one from the Bioconductor
repository by typing the following two commands in your R session:
<br>
<br>
<tt>
source('http://www.bioconductor.org/getBioC.R')<br>
getBioC('XML')<br>
</tt>
<br>
<p>

<font color=red>Note:</font> If R complains about missing registry keys
or something similar when you try to use the RMySQL library, you can 
install an old copy <a href='RMySQL_0.5-11.zip'>from here</a>.  Download
the file to your computer, then choose <tt>Packages -> Install from Local Zip File</tt>.
<p>
<font color=red>Note:</font> If you see a message like the following:
<pre>
Error in gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case, extended, fixed, useBytes) :
        input string 15 is invalid in this locale
</pre>
<p>
Then you should issue the following command before using <tt>readLines</tt>:
<pre>
Sys.setlocale('LC_ALL','C')
</pre>

<h2>About this Course</h2>
<p>
The goal of this course is to introduce you to a variety of programs and
technologies that are useful for organizing, manipulating and
visualizing data.  This includes the R statistical computing language,
the SQL language for working with databases, XML, the Document Object
Model and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) used by webservers and browsers.
</P>
<P>
Rather than concentrate on formulas and how they are computed, we'll use
existing software to explore a variety of statistical problems concerning
text and/or numbers, both numerically and graphically.   Students are
encouraged to download and install some of the software that we'll be using
to their own computers.
<P>
There are no prerequisites for the course, but students are expected to
spend time thinking about the problems that are presented in the course,
and to explore the software that we'll be using to solve those problems.
<h2>Grading</h2>
Grading will be based on 6 homework assignments (10% each), 
a midterm exam (20%) , and a final exam (20%).
<h2>Computers for Remote Access</h2>
If you are accessing the SCF remotely, use a computer name of the 
form scf-ugNN.berkeley.edu, where the NN stands for a number from 
01 to 27, for example scf-ug03.berkeley.edu .  Once you are logged in,
the command
<pre>
stathosts public
</pre>
will show you the names of additional computers that you can 
access remotely.  (You may need to add ".berkeley.edu" to the end
of the computer name.)
