     <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What's this course about?</h2>
The goal of this course is to introduce you to a variety of 
concepts and methods that are useful when dealing with data.
You can think of data as any information that could potentially
be studied to learn more about something.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some simple examples:

<ol type="1">
<li>Sales records for a company
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Won/Lost records for a sports team
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Web log listings
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Email messages
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Demographic Information found on the web
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What may be surprising is that some of the data (for example web log listings
or email) consists of text, not numbers.  It's increasingly important to 
be able to deal with text in order to look at the wide variety of information
that is available.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In most statistics courses, a lot of time is spent working on the 
preliminaries (formulas, algorithms, statistical concepts) in order to 
prepare the student for the interesting part of statistics, which is 
studying data for a problem that matters to you.  Unfortunately, by the 
time these preliminaries are covered, many students are bored or frustrated,
and they leave the course with a distorted view of statistics.  In this 
class, we're going to do things differently.  We will concentrate on:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li>Computer Languages - which will let us read in and manipulate data.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Graphical Techniques - which will allow us to display data in a way that
makes it easier to understand and easier to make decisions based on the data.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Technologies - so that we can present these techniques to someone who's
not as knowledgeable as us without too much misery.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The main computer language that we will be using in the course is a 
statistical programming environment known as R 
(<a href="http://r-project.org">http://r-project.org</a>).
R is freely downloadable and copyable, and you are strongly encouraged to 
install R on your own computer for use in this course and beyond.
We will use this language for both data acquisition, data manipulation and
producing graphical output.   R is not the ideal language for all of the 
tasks we're going to do, but in the interest of efficiency, we'll try to
use it for most things, and point you in the direction of other languages
that you might want to explore sometime in the future.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another tool that we'll use are UNIX shell commands, which allow you to 
store, copy and otherwise manipulate files which contain data, documents or
programs.
The computer accounts for this course will allow you to access computers
running a version of the UNIX operating system

<div class="p"><!----></div>
More and more commonly, data is stored on database servers, not in ordinary
files.  
Most database servers use some version of a language known as 
the Structured Query Language (SQL).  We'll use the open-source MySQL 
database as an example of an SQL database.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While you shouldn't have any problems understanding any of the statistical
techniques we study in this class, a certain level of complexity arises when
various techniques are combined together and presented as a start-to-finish
solution.  To learn how we can make techniques we've developed to others, 
we'll look at graphical user interfaces (GUIs) as well as using web servers
to get information from users and display results.

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Basic Concepts in Computing with Data</h2>
Most real-life projects that involve data can be broken down into several
steps:

<ol type="1">
<li>Data Acquisition - we need to find (or collect) the data, and get some 
representation of it into the computer
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Data Cleaning - Inevitably, there will be errors in the data, either because
they were entered incorrectly, we misunderstood the nature of the data, 
records were duplicated or omitted.   Many times data is presented for 
viewing, and extracting the data in some other form becomes a challenge.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Data Organization - Depending on what you want to do, you may need to 
reorganize your data.  This is especially true when you need to produce
graphical representations of the data.  Naturally, we need the appropriate
tools to do these tasks.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Data Modeling and Presentation - We may fit a statistical model to our 
data, or we may just produce a graph that shows what we think is important.
Often, a variety of models or graphs needs to be considered.  It's important
to know what techniques are available and whether they are accepted within
a particular user community.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Further, techniques such as simulation and resampling have been developed
to allow us to get information even in cases where we don't have exactly
the data that we'd like to have.

3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Short Note on Academic Integrity</h2>
One of the main ways you are going to learn in this course is by discussing
the material in class and in lab sections, and I feel that this is one of 
the most important aspects of the course.  However, the programs you write are
like an essay or term paper, and you should not share them with others, or ask
others to give their programs to you.    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The University has a very detailed code of student conduct, available at
<a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conductiii-vii.asp">http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conductiii-vii.asp</a>.  Please refer
to that document or talk to me if there are any questions.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to R</h2>
Here are some basic concepts about R that we'll return to later 
in more detail:

<ul>
<li>R can be used as a calculator.  Any statements that you type at the
R prompt will be executed, and the answer printed:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;12&nbsp;+&nbsp;9
[1]&nbsp;21
&#62;&nbsp;17.1*&nbsp;13
[1]&nbsp;222.3
&#62;&nbsp;554&nbsp;/3
[1]&nbsp;184.6667

</pre>
 Notice that spaces can be placed wherever you'd like, 
as long as they're not in the middle of a number.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
R is just as happy to work with vectors (more than one value) as
it is with scalars (single values).  The function to create a vector
from individual values is <tt>c()</tt>:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;c(10,12,19)&nbsp;+&nbsp;c(8,5,9)
[1]&nbsp;18&nbsp;17&nbsp;28
&#62;&nbsp;c(1,2,3)&nbsp;*&nbsp;c(3,2,1)
[1]&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;3

</pre>
 When you use operators like <tt>*</tt>(multiplication) 
or <tt>+</tt>(addition), R does the operations element by element
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> 
There are three ways to get help in R:

<ol type="1">
<li> The <tt>help()</tt> command, which can be abbreviated by <tt>?</tt>,
will open a help page in a browswer with information about a particular
command.  For example, to get help on the <tt>c</tt> function mentioned
above, you could type:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;help(c)

</pre>
 or

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;?c

</pre>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The <tt>help.search()</tt> function, which can be abbreviated by
<tt>??</tt>, will show other functions already installed in your version
of R that relate to a particular topic.  For example, to see about functions
that combine things in R, you could type

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;??combine

</pre>
  <tt>help.search()</tt> only looks for functions already installed
on your computer.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
The <tt>RSiteSearch()</tt> command will open a browser to a searchable
database of questions and answers posted on the R-help mailing list. (See
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/mail.html">http://www.r-project.org/mail.html</a>
for more information on the R-help mailing list.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
When you type the name of an object into R, it will display that object.
This can be frustrating when you want to actually run the object.  For
example, if you type <tt>q</tt> at the R prompt, you'll see:

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;q
function&nbsp;(save&nbsp;=&nbsp;"default",&nbsp;status&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;runLast&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE)&nbsp;
.Internal(quit(save,&nbsp;status,&nbsp;runLast))
&lt;environment:&nbsp;namespace:base&#62;

</pre>
 To actually execute the <tt>q</tt> command, type

<pre>
&#62;&nbsp;q()

</pre>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>
