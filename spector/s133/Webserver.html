1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a Mac or Linux computer to run R CGI programs</h2>
If you'd like to run your CGI programs on your own computer before 
moving them over to the SCF computers where I can test them, it's
fairly easy to do on Mac or Linux systems.  (If you've got Cygwin
installed on a Windows computer, you can find information  for 
setting things up <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic/firth/software/cgiwithr/windows.txt">here</a>.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux</h2>
First make sure that the <tt>apache2</tt> program is installed on your 
system.  If you're already running a webserver, then you're all set.
After installing
the <tt>CGIwithR</tt> package in R, you'll need to copy two files from the
installation to your system's cgi area.  These two files can be found in
<tt>/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/CGIwithR/cgi-bin</tt>, and they are
called <tt>R.cgi</tt> and <tt>.Rprofile</tt>.  Copy these two files to
<tt>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</tt>.  You can now add your R scripts to that same 
directory and access them as <tt>http://localhost/cgi-bin/R.cgi/scriptname.cgi</tt>,
where <tt>scriptname.cgi</tt> is the name of your CGI script.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac</h2>
To activate the apache webserver that's part of Mac OS X, open the 
System Preferences pane (through the Apple menu), and choose the 
"Sharing" preference.  Click on "Web Sharing" to start the webserver.
After installing the <tt>CGIwithR</tt> package in R, you'll need to copy
two files from the installation to your system's cgi area.  These two files
can be found in <tt>/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Version/Current/Resources/library/CGIwithR/cgi-bin</tt>, and they are called <tt>R.cgi</tt> and <tt>.Rprofile</tt>.  Copy 
these two files to <tt>/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables</tt>.   
In the file <tt>R.cgi</tt>, find the line that looks like this:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
R_DEFAULT=/usr/local/bin/R

</pre>
and change it to 

<pre>
R_DEFAULT=/usr/bin/R

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can now add your 
R scripts to that same directory, and your HTML files in 
<tt>/Library/Webserver/Documents</tt>.
You can then 
access the html files as <tt>http://localhost/file.html</tt> where 
<tt>file.html</tt> is the name of your html file, and the CGI files as
<tt>http://localhost/cgi-bin/R.cgi/scriptname.cgi</tt>, where <tt>scriptname.cgi</tt> is the 
name of your CGI script.
