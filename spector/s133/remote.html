<title> Accessing the Statistical Computing Facility Remotely</title>
 
<h1 align="center">Accessing the Statistical Computing Facility Remotely </h1>
    <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
In order connect to the SCF from
a remote (non-SCF) computer, you must have a 
program which uses the secure shell (SSH) protocol 
to communicate with other computers. 
An SSH program alone will not allow you to 
view graphics or images remotely.
For these purposes, you need an X Windows server 
(sometimes known as X11)
either running natively on your computer, or via an
X Windows emulator.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Depending on your operating system, one or both of
these programs may already be installed on your computer.
The next section will explain how to obtain the
necessary programs if they are not already available, followed by 
information on transfering files from the SCF to your local computer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you don't have a broadband connection,
you may find that the response when using X Windows remotely
may be too slow to be useful; but
with patience, you should
be able to access the SCF remotely with few problems.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Software</h2>

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux</h3>
Linux natively runs the X Windows system, and most Linux systems
have the <tt>ssh</tt> program available to securely connect  to 
remote systems.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.2">
2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac OS X</h3>
The <tt>ssh</tt> command is available through the Terminal application
(available in <tt>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</tt>).  For versions
of Mac OS X since Panther, there is 
an installation package for X11 (<tt>X11User.pkg</tt>) on the Developer Disk.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Windows</h3>
To connect to the SCF remotely, you can use a free program called
<tt>putty</tt>.  You can download it from
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/&#126;sgtatham/putty/download.html</a>
This will allow you to  run programs remotely, but it will not allow
you to use the display manager, or to view graphics.
To do this, you need an X Windows emulator.
If you have a CalNet ID, you can download Exceed 2008 from
<a href="http://software-central.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley Software Distribution</a>
A free alternative to Exceed is the
<tt>Cygwin X Windows System</tt>.  There are excellent instructions
for installing this software at <a href="http://x.cygwin.com">Cygwin/X</a>.
Basically, you first download a program called <tt>setup.exe</tt>, which
makes it possible to install a wide variety of software; you need choose
only four packages: <tt>xorg-x11-base</tt>, <tt>X-startup-scripts</tt>, <tt>inetutils</tt> and
<tt>openssh</tt> (Clicking on the <tt>View</tt> button in the <tt>setup.exe</tt>
window until it displays "<tt>Full</tt>" makes it easier to find the
packages you need).  Once everything is installed you can double click on
<tt>c:\cygwin\usr\X11R6\bin\startxwin.bat</tt> to start the system.
A terminal window will
open, and you can use the ssh command as described below.
The <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/docs/ug/cygwin-x-ug.html">User's Guide</a>
covers just about every step of installation and use of the software.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Commands</h3>

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.4.1">
2.4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Windows: putty</h4>
To connect to a remote host using <tt>putty</tt>, click on the <tt>Session</tt> category
in the left-hand pane of <tt>putty</tt>'s window, and enter the hostname in the appropriate box.  Click
<tt>Open</tt>, and a terminal will appear, prompting for you login name and
password.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To display graphics through putty, you need to activate 
X11 Forwarding.   In the left hand pane of <tt>putty</tt>'s window,
click on the plus sign near <tt>SSH</tt> under the <tt>Connection</tt> category.
A choice of <tt>X11</tt> should appear; click on it, and check the box
labeled <tt>Enable X11 forwarding</tt>.
Once forwarding has been enabled (you should only need to do it once), and 
<tt>Exceed</tt> has been started, 
graphics programs on the remote host will display on your computer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc2.4.2">
2.4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>ssh</tt> command</h4>
If you're using a system with the <tt>ssh</tt> command, type

<pre>
ssh&nbsp;-X&nbsp;username@hostname

</pre>
to connect to an SCF computer.
The <tt>-X</tt> (upper case X) in the <tt>ssh</tt> command sets up the X11 Tunneling
necessary for displaying graphics.

 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;File Transfer</h2>
If you want to print out your programs, listings and graphics on your
local printer, the easiest route is to copy the files from the SCF
computers to your computer and then to print them in the usual way.
The best way is to use a file transfer program on your local computer,
although other means are possible.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1">
3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux</h3>
The command line <tt>scp</tt> command, described below,  is probably 
the best way to transfer files from one computer to another.  If you'd
prefer a graphical client, programs like konqueror will accept the
<tt>sftp://</tt> protocol.  For example, if your username is  s133xy, you
would be able to access your files on the SCF computers by going to

<pre>
sftp://hostname.berkeley.edu/class/u/s133/s133xy

</pre>

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2">
3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac OS X</h3>
The command line <tt>scp</tt> command, described below, can be accessed
through the terminal (<tt>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</tt>).  Although
the finder doesn't directly support the sftp protocol, the freeware 
program <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> provides a
nice graphical frontend to the sftp command.  To use <tt>Fugu</tt>, enter 
your username and 
an appropriate hostname in the <tt>Connect to:</tt> field;  you'll be 
prompted for a password when <tt>Fugu</tt> connects to the remote server.
Your remote files will appear in <tt>Fugu</tt>'s right-hand pane, where
they can be dragged and dropped to a location of your choice in the (local)
left-hand pane.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3">
3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Windows</h3>
If you've installed the SSH Secure Server software, there should be a 
desktop icon labeled <tt>SSH Secure File Transfer Client</tt>.  Double
click on the icon, and click on <tt>Quick Connect</tt>, and a window prompting 
for
hostname and username will appear.  Leave the other options at their default
values.   Once you're connected, your remote (SCF) files will appear in the
right hand pane; you can drag and drop them to a suitable local location. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are also a number of free graphical sftp clients available for Windows; 
one nice and easy-to-use one is <a href="http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a>.  
If you choose the Explorer view instead of the default 
Norton Commander view, your SCF account will appear as a normal 
explorer window, allowing you to drag and drop files; simply enter
your username and a suitable hostname to connect.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.4">
3.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If All Else Fails</h3>
If you can't use the previously described methods, you can email
files from the SCF system to an email account of your choice.  
One way is to use the command line program <tt>pine</tt>.  To send files
as attachments with pine, enter the following command:

<pre>
pine&nbsp;emailaddress&nbsp;-attach&nbsp;file1&nbsp;-attach&nbsp;file2&nbsp;...

</pre>
After hitting Return, type control-X to send the mail, and <tt>Y</tt> to 
confirm it.
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a 5 Mb limit on attachments to emails sent through
the SCF.  While this should pose no problems with text files saved from the 
program editor, complex graphics may be too large to send through email.
Please check the size of the file you're sending (with the UNIX command
<tt>ls -l</tt>) before reporting a problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc3.5">
3.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>scp</tt> command</h3>
The syntax for the scp command is: 

<pre>
scp&nbsp;username@hostname:file&nbsp;local-directory

</pre>
You'll be prompted for your password;  after entering it and hitting 
Return, the file transfer will start.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To use wildcard patterns on the remote (SCF) machine, precede the 
wildcard character with a backslash (<tt>\</tt>).  For example to copy
all the pdf files from your SCF account, to the current directory on
your local computer, 
use a command like:

<pre>
scp&nbsp;username@hostname:\*.pdf&nbsp;.

</pre>
