1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>RMySQL</tt></h2>
If you check on CRAN, you'll see that  the <tt>RMySQL</tt> package is not available for 
Windows.  (If you use Mac OSX or Linux, you can install RMySQL in the usual way.)  
To get around this problem, I've created a version of the RMySQL library that you 
should be able to get to work under Windows.  You can download it from 
<a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/RMySQL_0.7-5.zip">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/RMySQL_0.7-5.zip</a>. 
To install it, download the file to your computer, choose 
Packages-&#62;Install from Local Zip File , and navigate to wherever you stored the file.
To use the package, you'll also need to install the <tt>DBI</tt> package in the usual
way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unfortunately, there's one extra detail that you have to take care of before you
can load the package.  You need to set up an environmental variable that points to
the directory where the <tt>RMySQL</tt> package was installed.  This will be a folder 
called <tt>RMySql</tt> inside the <tt>library</tt> folder in the folder in which R was 
installed.  We'll create an <tt>.Rprofile</tt> file in the working directory that R 
uses when you start it so that you won't have to enter the command every time you want
to use the library.  At the R prompt, type

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
edit()

</pre>
 When the editor opens, type this line into the editor window:

<pre>
Sys.setenv(MYSQL_HOME=paste(Sys.getenv('R_HOME'),'library','RMySQL',sep='\\'))

</pre>
Close the file, and save it under the name <tt>.Rprofile</tt> - notice the leading period
and the capital R in the file name.  Now exit R.  
When you run R in the future, you can simply type

<pre>
library{RMySQL}

</pre>
 to use the package as we've seen in class.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>RODBC</tt></h2>
As an alternative to the above procedure, you can use the <tt>RODBC</tt> package,
which uses Windows' Open Database Connection facility.  To use this facility with a 
particular database, you need to have a piece of software known as a connector 
installed and configured on your computer.  You can download a MySQL ODBC connector
at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/5.1.html">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/5.1.html</a>.  (I recommend that you use the MSI version of the installer for
your version of Windows.  When you click the Download button, it will look like you need
a password to access the download, but if you look carefully you'll see a link
labeled "No thanks, just take me to the downloads!".)  Download and install the 
connector.  You'll see no indication that anything has happened, but you can now 
configure the connector as follows:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Go to Control Panel-&#62;Administrative Tools, and double click on "<tt>Data Sources (ODBC)</tt>".
Click "<tt>Add</tt>", and choose "<tt>MySQL ODBC 5.1 Driver</tt>" from the dropdown menu.  
(As a side note,
notice the wide range of database connectors that are already available for use through
ODBC.  After configuring any one of them, you can use them in R in a similar way to the 
way we'll access <tt>MySQL</tt> through <tt>RODBC</tt>.)  After clicking "<tt>Finish</tt>", enter 
the following:

<pre>
Data&nbsp;Source&nbsp;Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mysql&nbsp;(or&nbsp;some&nbsp;other&nbsp;name&nbsp;if&nbsp;you'd&nbsp;like)
Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you&nbsp;want
TCP/IP&nbsp;Server:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;localhost
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stat133
Password:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T0pSecr3t

</pre>
Notice that we've specified <tt>localhost</tt> as the server.  That's because you'll
need to access the MySQL server that runs on my office computer through an SSH tunnel, as 
described at <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/mysqlt.html">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/mysqlt.html</a>.  If you've established the tunnel, you can click the "<tt>Test</tt>" button.
You should see a window with the message "Connection Successful".  At that point, you can choose
<tt>Baseball</tt> from the "<tt>Database</tt>" dropdown menu.  (If you haven't yet configured the 
tunnel, don't worry - we can specify the database when we connect to the server.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Once you've entered the information, Click "OK" as necessary to close the <tt>ODBC</tt> 
control panel. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, in R, install the <tt>RODBC</tt> package in the usual way.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you've already set the database to <tt>Baseball</tt> in the previous step, and you've 
got the SSH tunnel running, you can connect to the SQL server by entering

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
con&nbsp;=&nbsp;odbcConnect('mysql')

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you haven't specified the database when configuring the connector, use

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>
con&nbsp;=&nbsp;odbcConnect('mysql;db=baseball')

</pre>
 (Of course if you used a name different than "msyql" when you configured the
connector, you would use that name when you connect.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When you connect through <tt>RODBC</tt>, the function to make queries is <tt>sqlQuery</tt>;
other useful functions are <tt>sqlTables</tt> and <tt>sqlColumns</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you're using Mac OSX and would like to use <tt>RODBC</tt> to connect to the MySQL server,
download the appropriate connector from the MySQL website, and go to 
Applications-&#62;Utilities-&#62;ODBC Administrator .  The process of configuring the connector
is very similar to the method described above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Final Note</h2>
I'll do everything I can to help you get one of these methods working on your computer, but
if you encounter problems, remember that you can always connect to the SQL server through any
of the SCF computers by specifying a hostname of <tt>springer</tt> , <i>i.e</i> you don't 
need an SSH tunnel when you use the SCF computers.  To use the SCF computers, you can 
go to Evans 342, or you can access them remotely from anywhere with an internet connection
by following the instructions at <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/remote.html">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/remote.html</a>.
