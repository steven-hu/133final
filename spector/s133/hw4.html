<li>Two applications where XML is already widely used are RSS (really simple
syndication), and the distribution of television listings for use in
home theater systems (XMLTV).  In this assignment, we're going to use R
to extract information from these readily available XML documents.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="a">
<li>RSS is a format that is used to provide information about news stories,
blog entries, or any other information that can be broken down into 
individual items.  When you see a symbol like this <img src="RSS.png">
or this <img src="XML.png">
on a web page, it indicates a link to an RSS feed.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write a <b>function</b>, which accepts the URL of an RSS feed, and returns
a data frame with the headlines (titles), descriptions, and URLs (links)  of the objects in the feed.
You can use the RSS feed 
of Yahoo headlines available at <br />
<a href="http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories">http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/topstories</a>
to develop your function.
Then find at least two other RSS feeds, preferably at a site you're interested
in, and use your function on them.  (You can find some feeds at <br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/support/news/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=59255">http://www.google.com/support/news/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=59255</a>.  You can turn any <tt>bing.com</tt> 
search into an RSS feed by taking the URL for the search and appending <tt>&amp;format=rss</tt>.  Another way to find RSS feeds is by
adding <tt>filetype:rss</tt> to a Google search.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>

At <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/listings.xml.gz">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/listings.xml.gz</a>, there
is a gzipped file containing five days of television listings for over 200 channels.
This XML file has two separate trees - one which describes the channels and
the other which describes the programs.  You'll need to use 
<tt>xmlElementsByTagName</tt> to separate them before processing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
From these TV listings, use the <tt>XML</tt> library in R to create a 
data frame with columns for starting time, channel, title and description
of each of the programs represented in the listings.  Notice that some of
this information is stored as attributes in the XML tags, so you'll need
to use <tt>xmlAttrs</tt> to extract this information.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once you've got the data frame set up, choose a show or topic that you're 
interested in, and use R to print the rows of the data frame corresponding
to those programs that match your criteria.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
Using the builtin data set <tt>iris</tt>, use the <tt>rpart</tt> library in R to 
build a classification tree to predict the value of <tt>Species</tt> for each
observation.  Write a sentence which describes the prediction rule that your 
<tt>rpart</tt> analysis produced.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Next, using the <tt>lda</tt> function in the <tt>MASS</tt> library, classify
the species of the observations using linear discriminant analysis.   Finally, using
the <tt>knn.cv</tt> function from the <tt>class</tt> library, use kth-nearest 
neighbor classification on the species of the observations.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For each of the three methods, calculate the percent of observations that were
misclassified in order to determine which method was most effective in classifying
the observations.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
At <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/teeth.csv">http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/data/teeth.csv</a>, there is a CSV file containing the 
names of animals and the numbers of various types of teeth (both top and 
bottom incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) that they have.  Use cluster
analysis to find groups of animals that are similar, based on the numbers of 
different kinds of teeth that they have.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Note: </b>If there are other data sets that you are interested that are
appropriate for classification or cluster analysis, you can substitute them
for the data sets in parts 2 and 3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Your submission should be contained in a <em>single</em> pdf file, 
containing all the R code you used for the assignment.
Email this file to me (<tt>s133@stat.berkeley.edu</tt>), with your 
name
in the subject of the email message and on the report, 
by 11:59PM (plus or minus a minute)
on the due date. Make certain to save a copy of your email submission.
